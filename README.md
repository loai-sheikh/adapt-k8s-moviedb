# moviedb-react-node Adapt Starter

An Adapt starter project that is a movie database application.

It includes:

* A React front end, created with create-react-app
* A Node.js REST API back end that can be queried to search the movie database
* A static HTTP server to serve the application's HTML, CSS, and other static content
* A Postgres database, which can be automatically populated with sample data for doing end-to-end testing.
* A URL router that acts as the single endpoint for the application, routing API requests to the API back end and all other requests to the static HTTP server.
